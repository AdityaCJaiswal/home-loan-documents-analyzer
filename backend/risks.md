# Risk: Balloon Payment
- **Description:** A loan that requires a single, unusually large payment at the end of the loan's term. The monthly payments are often artificially low, making the loan seem affordable.
- **Why it's harmful:** It's deceptive. The borrower is often unable to pay the final massive sum, forcing them to refinance (often on worse terms), sell their asset (like their home), or default on the loan.
- **Keywords to find:** "balloon payment," "lump sum payment," "final payment," "single payment due at maturity"

# Risk: Prepayment Penalty
    - **Description:** A clause that charges the borrower a fee if they pay off the loan, or a significant portion of it, ahead of schedule.
    - **Why it's harmful:** It traps the borrower. If interest rates drop or their financial situation improves, they are penalized for trying to save money by refinancing or paying off their debt. It's a fee for being responsible.
- **Keywords to find:** "prepayment penalty," "early repayment fee," "fee for early settlement," "penalty for early payment," "prepayment charge"

# Risk: Negative Amortization
- **Description:** A loan where the scheduled monthly payments are so low they do not cover the full amount of interest due. The unpaid interest is then added back to the principal loan balance.
- **Why it's harmful:** The borrower's debt *increases* over time, even while they are making every single payment. They can end up owing more than they originally borrowed.
- **Keywords to find:** "negative amortization," "principal balance may increase," "unpaid interest will be added to the principal," "deferred interest"

# Risk: Mandatory Arbitration Clause
- **Description:** A clause that forces the borrower to give up their right to sue the lender in a public court of law. Instead, any dispute must be settled by a private "arbitrator," often chosen or paid for by the lender.
- **Why it's harmful:** It strips the borrower of their legal rights and consumer protections. Arbitration overwhelmingly favors the corporation, is private (so others can't learn from the case), and its decisions are final and cannot be easily appealed.
- **Keywords to find:** "mandatory arbitration," "binding arbitration," "waive your right to a jury trial," "disputes shall be settled by arbitration," "all disputes... will be resolved by... arbitrator"

# Risk: Loan Packing / Excessive Fees
- **Description:** The practice of "packing" a loan with unnecessary, often unwanted, and high-cost add-ons. This can include things like single-premium credit insurance (where the insurance fee is added to the loan principal), gap insurance, or excessive origination and processing fees.
- **Why it's harmful:** It inflates the total loan amount without the borrower's full understanding. They end up paying interest on services they never asked for or needed.
- **Keywords to find:** "single-premium credit insurance," "loan processing fee," "origination fee," "application fee," "underwriting fee," "gap insurance," "credit life insurance"

# Risk: Loan Flipping
- **Description:** A practice where a lender repeatedly convinces a borrower to refinance their loan, often with no tangible benefit to the borrower (like a lower interest rate).
- **Why it's harmful:** Each "flip" or refinance transaction generates new fees (origination, closing costs, etc.) for the lender, which are added to the loan principal. It's a method for the lender to "strip" equity from a borrower's asset by constantly charging them for new, unnecessary loans.
- **Keywords to find:** "refinance," "consolidation," "new loan," "fees for refinancing" (Note: This one is harder to find in a single clause, it's a *pattern* of behavior, but the keywords will help flag documents for review).
