# Risk: Balloon Payment
- **Description:** A loan that requires a single, unusually large payment at the end of the loan's term. The monthly payments are often artificially low, making the loan seem affordable.
- **Why it's harmful:** It's deceptive. The borrower is often unable to pay the final massive sum, forcing them to refinance (often on worse terms), sell their asset (like their home), or default on the loan.

# Risk: Prepayment Penalty
- **Description:** A clause that charges the borrower a fee if they pay off the loan, or a significant portion of it, ahead of schedule.
- **Why it's harmful:** It traps the borrower. If interest rates drop or their financial situation improves, they are penalized for trying to save money by refinancing or paying off their debt. It's a fee for being responsible.
